# **Detailed Breakdown**

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction & Framing (5 min)

**Key Points:**

* Why this topic matters ‚Äî it's not about *AI replacing developers*, but about *augmenting cognition*.
* AI is becoming part of the toolchain like compilers, linters, and version control.
* Developers here already use Copilot ‚Äî today we explore *how to get better at it.*

**No slides. Use simple Markdown headings in your code editor or Obsidian-style presentation.**

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What is AI-Driven Development? (10 min)

**Core Concepts:**

* Foundation models (LLMs) as fuzzy pair programmers.
* Strength: Pattern completion, boilerplate, simple algorithms, docstrings, tests.
* Weakness: Logical reasoning, architectural decisions, long-range dependencies.
* AI-driven software development != Auto-coding ‚Äî it's interactive co-creation.
* Models hallucinate: high fluency, low factual grounding.

**Diagram:** Mermaid sequence diagram to show developer-AI interaction loop.

Example:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant AI as Copilot
    Dev->>AI: Write a function to parse CSV
    AI-->>Dev: Suggests code
    Dev->>AI: Modify to handle edge case
    AI-->>Dev: Updated code
    Dev->>Dev: Validates, tests, integrates
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Live Demo: Copilot in IntelliJ (15 min)

**Goal:** Show both the power and the limitations.

**Demo ideas:**

* Implement a small REST API controller.
* Generate tests.
* Refactor some legacy-looking code.
* Ask it for architectural suggestions (and show where it gets it wrong).
* Use *"Explain this code"* feature.

**Key takeaway:**

> *AI provides velocity, not judgment.*

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Dos and Don'ts (10 min)

| ‚úÖ Do                                                                          | ‚ùå Don't                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use AI to **bootstrap boilerplate** code                                      | Expect it to get **architecture right**                           |
| Use **short, incremental prompts**                                            | Dump large multi-paragraph specs and expect coherent output       |
| Think like a **code reviewer**: Always verify AI output                       | Assume correctness ‚Äî especially on edge cases, concurrency, state |
| Use AI to **refactor and explain unfamiliar code**                            | Trust its explanations without your own understanding             |
| Be very **explicit**: "Do X in Y style with Z library"                        | Leave instructions vague ‚Äî LLMs hallucinate gaps                  |
| Use AI to write **parameterized tests** and mocks                             | Rely on AI-generated tests as your sole safety net                |
| Use **code context carefully**: provide files, function headers               | Assume AI can infer missing business rules                        |
| Leverage AI for **docstrings, comments, and documentation**                   | Let documentation drift by not validating technical accuracy      |
| Use AI as a **partner, not a servant**: interactive back-and-forth works best | Expect full solutions from single-shot prompts                    |

---

# **Bonus Insight **

* AI models sometimes **repeat bugs** you just fixed.
* They **prefer happy-path code** unless explicitly told otherwise.
* They may silently **invent APIs** that don't exist.
* Sometimes they confidently propose **logically invalid fixes**.
* They are prone to **state inconsistency** when large context windows are overloaded.

---

**Key Quote you might even project during the talk:**

> "Treat the model as an eager junior developer. Good at cranking out boilerplate. Bad at nuance. Always needs code review."
---

Here‚Äôs an enhanced version of the **Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts** section, now featuring the real-world ‚Äúagentic engineering‚Äù story from the *claude‚Äëcode‚Äëflow* repository by ruvnet ‚Äî perfect to illustrate how AI-driven orchestration works in practice.

## ‚úÖ Do & ‚ùå Don‚Äôt (Enhanced)

| ‚úÖ Do                                                                                                                                                    | ‚ùå Don't                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Use **multi-stage prompts** ‚Äî break down tasks into clear, atomic steps                                                                                 | Assume one-shot prompts will yield correct results           |
| Treat the model as a **partner of partners** ‚Äî e.g., use **Claude‚ÄëFlow** to spawn and coordinate multiple specialized agents                            | Expect a single AI tool to handle everything flawlessly      |
| Empower agents with specific roles: coder, tester, researcher, security auditor                                                                         | Leave agent roles undefined and hope for the best            |
| Use **shared memory** across agents ‚Äî Claude‚ÄëFlow‚Äôs memory bank ensures context and consistency ([github.com][1], [reddit.com][2], [codenotary.com][3]) | Ignore persistence‚Äîeach prompt loses context and coherence   |
| Build by leveraging **recursive development**: let agents help build their own orchestrator                                                             | Treat the system as static ‚Äî no continuous improvement loop  |
| Scale to parallel tasks: let a swarm of agents handle complex workflows simultaneously                                                                  | Funnel everything sequentially ‚Äî underutilizing AI potential |
| Monitor each agent‚Äôs progress via dashboards or terminal UIs, inspect logs                                                                              | Stay dark ‚Äî no visibility means no control                   |
| Be clear about **failure policies**, rollbacks, agent retry logic                                                                                       | Trust agents implicitly ‚Äî no undo or safe guardrails         |
| Combine advanced agent orchestration (Claude‚ÄëFlow) with interactive prompt-based tools (Copilot, Cursor) for complementary strengths                    | Use only one toolchain ‚Äî risk redundancy or gaps             |

### üß† The *claude‚Äëcode‚Äëflow* Story: Agentic Engineering in Action

* **Multi-agent orchestration**: ruvnet‚Äôs repository demonstrates running dozens of Claude-powered agents in parallel (researcher, coder, tester, security‚Äëauditor) ‚Äî all coordinated via a shared memory bank and orchestrator ([github.com][1]).
* **Recursive development**: As noted on Reddit, the author built *claude‚Äëflow* itself using the same system ‚Äî effectively a self-improving, modular engineering swarm ([reddit.com][2]).
* **Cost-effective scaling**: One developer comments you can run ‚Äúa full AI R\&D team...for what you'd pay a junior dev for a few hours‚Äù ([reddit.com][2]).
* **Shared memory & monitoring**: With a CRDT-backed memory bank, agents coordinate knowledge and maintain coherence across tasks ([github.com][1]).

---

### üé§ How to Use This Story in Your Talk

**Live narrative path:**

1. **Introduce**: ‚ÄúThis isn't just hypothetical‚Äîlook at *claude‚Äëcode‚Äëflow*, where hundreds of agents collaborate on real code.‚Äù
2. **Explain the setup**: Describe the roles, shared memory, recursive development loop, and parallelism.
3. **Pull out lessons**:

   * Task orchestration > one-shot coding
   * Context sharing prevents duplication and inconsistencies
   * Monitoring + failure control = production readiness
4. **Contrast**: ‚ÄúCompare that to using a single Copilot window where context is lost per prompt.‚Äù
5. **Reinforce Do‚Äôs**: Highlight multi-stage prompts, memory, monitoring.
6. **Warn Don‚Äôts**: Avoid unmanaged scaling, missing rollback logic, ignoring logs.

---

Together with Diwank‚Äôs field-notes, this story makes your **Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts** both concrete and actionable ‚Äî rooted in community practice and real code.
