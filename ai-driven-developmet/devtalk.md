# *"AI-Driven Software Development: Friend, Foe, or Rubber Duck?"*

# Agenda

- Framing: Why this matters
- What is AI-Driven Development?
- Demo: Codex in VS Code
- Do‚Äôs & Don‚Äôts (Field Notes)
- Agentic Engineering (Claude Code Flow)
- The Future
- Q&A

# Why This Topic?

- AI is now embedded in our developer workflows.
- Developers ‚â† replaced, but **augmented**.
- We gain velocity ‚Äî but must still apply judgment.
- How do we become *good* at AI-driven development?

# What is AI-Driven Development?

<div style="display: flex; gap: 2rem;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">

  **Core Concepts:**

  - Foundation models (LLMs) as fuzzy pair programmers
  - **Strength:** Pattern completion, boilerplate, simple algorithms, docstrings, tests
  - **Weakness:** Logical reasoning, architectural decisions, long-range dependencies
  - AI-driven software development != Auto-coding ‚Äî it's interactive co-creation
  - Models hallucinate: high fluency, low factual grounding

# Live Demo: Codex in VS Code (15 min)

**Goal:** Show both the power and the limitations.

**Demo ideas:**

- Implement a small REST API controller.
- Generate tests.
- Refactor some legacy-looking code.
- Ask it for architectural suggestions (and show where it gets it wrong).
- Use *"Explain this code"* feature.

**Key takeaway:**

> *AI provides velocity, not judgment.*

# Dos and Don'ts

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use AI to **bootstrap boilerplate** code                                      | Expect it to get **architecture right**                           |
| Use **short, incremental prompts**                                            | Dump large multi-paragraph specs and expect coherent output       |
| Think like a **code reviewer**: Always verify AI output                       | Assume correctness ‚Äî especially on edge cases, concurrency, state |
| Use AI to **refactor and explain unfamiliar code**                            | Trust its explanations without your own understanding             |
| Be very **explicit**: "Do X in Y style with Z library"                        | Leave instructions vague ‚Äî LLMs hallucinate gaps                  |
| Use AI to write **parameterized tests** and mocks                             | Rely on AI-generated tests as your sole safety net                |
| Use **code context carefully**: provide files, function headers               | Assume AI can infer missing business rules                        |
| Leverage AI for **docstrings, comments, and documentation**                   | Let documentation drift by not validating technical accuracy      |
| Use AI as a **partner, not a servant**: interactive back-and-forth works best | Expect full solutions from single-shot prompts                    |

# Bonus Insight

- AI models sometimes **repeat bugs** you just fixed.
- They **prefer happy-path code** unless explicitly told otherwise.
- They may silently **invent APIs** that don't exist.
- Sometimes they confidently propose **logically invalid fixes**.
- They are prone to **state inconsistency** when large context windows are overloaded.

---
> "Treat the model as an eager junior developer. Good at cranking out boilerplate. Bad at nuance. Always needs code review."

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Use **multi-stage prompts** ‚Äî break down tasks into clear, atomic steps                                                                                 | Assume one-shot prompts will yield correct results           |
| Treat the model as a **partner of partners** ‚Äî e.g., use **Claude‚ÄëFlow** to spawn and coordinate multiple specialized agents                            | Expect a single AI tool to handle everything flawlessly      |
| Empower agents with specific roles: coder, tester, researcher, security auditor                                                                         | Leave agent roles undefined and hope for the best            |
| Use **shared memory** across agents ‚Äî Claude‚ÄëFlow‚Äôs memory bank ensures context and consistency ([github.com][1], [reddit.com][2], [codenotary.com][3]) | Ignore persistence‚Äîeach prompt loses context and coherence   |
| Build by leveraging **recursive development**: let agents help build their own orchestrator                                                             | Treat the system as static ‚Äî no continuous improvement loop  |

| Combine advanced agent orchestration (Claude‚ÄëFlow) with interactive prompt-based tools (Copilot, Cursor) for complementary strengths                    | Use only one toolchain ‚Äî risk redundancy or gaps             |

# üß† The *claude‚Äëcode‚Äëflow* Story: Agentic Engineering in Action

- **Multi-agent orchestration**: ruvnet‚Äôs repository demonstrates running dozens of Claude-powered agents in parallel (researcher, coder, tester, security‚Äëauditor) ‚Äî all coordinated via a shared memory bank and orchestrator ([github.com][1]).
- **Recursive development**: As noted on Reddit, the author built *claude‚Äëflow* itself using the same system ‚Äî effectively a self-improving, modular engineering swarm ([reddit.com][2]).
- **Cost-effective scaling**: One developer comments you can run ‚Äúa full AI R\&D team...for what you'd pay a junior dev for a few hours‚Äù ([reddit.com][2]).
- **Shared memory & monitoring**: With a CRDT-backed memory bank, agents coordinate knowledge and maintain coherence across tasks ([github.com][1]).

### üé§ How to Use This Story in Your Talk

**Live narrative path:**

1. **Introduce**: ‚ÄúThis isn't just hypothetical‚Äîlook at *claude‚Äëcode‚Äëflow*, where hundreds of agents collaborate on real code.‚Äù
2. **Explain the setup**: Describe the roles, shared memory, recursive development loop, and parallelism.
3. **Pull out lessons**:
   * Task orchestration > one-shot coding
   * Context sharing prevents duplication and inconsistencies
   * Monitoring + failure control = production readiness
4. **Contrast**: ‚ÄúCompare that to using a single Copilot window where context is lost per prompt.‚Äù
5. **Reinforce Do‚Äôs**: Highlight multi-stage prompts, memory, monitoring.
6. **Warn Don‚Äôts**: Avoid unmanaged scaling, missing rollback logic, ignoring logs.

**Next steps?**
